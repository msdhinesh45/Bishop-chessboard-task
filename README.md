# ♟️ Bishop Chessboard Task

**Live Demo:** [Click here to view](https://msdhinesh45.github.io/Bishop-chessboard-task/)

This project demonstrates the movement rules of the **bishop** in chess using a visual and interactive chessboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 How it works

- The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, styled to alternate black and white squares.
- When you **hover** over any square, it highlights all the squares that a bishop can move to from that position — diagonally.
- A button at the top also gives a simple alert explaining the bishop's movement direction.
